# ðŸ“Š Causal ATE Estimation API

This project implements a Flask-based API that estimates the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** using a linear regression model inspired by the **Rubin Causal Model**. It determines the causal impact of a treatment (e.g. participation in a carbon offset program) on engagement score, controlling for sustainability spending.

---

## ðŸ§  Model

The regression formula used is:

```
Yáµ‰ = Î± + Ï„Â·Wáµ‰ + Î²Â·Xáµ‰ + Îµáµ‰
```

Where:
- **Yáµ‰**: Engagement Score (observed outcome)
- **Wáµ‰**: Treatment indicator (1 = participated, 0 = did not)
- **Xáµ‰**: Sustainability Spending ($1,000s)
- **Î±, Ï„, Î²**: Parameters to be estimated
- **Ï„**: Interpreted as the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**

## ðŸš€ Quickstart with Docker

### ðŸ’  Build and Run

```bash
docker build -t my-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-api
```

---

## ðŸ“¬ API Usage

Send a POST request with JSON data:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/estimate_ate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @data.json
```
