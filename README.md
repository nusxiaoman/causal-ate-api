# 📊 Causal ATE Estimation API

This project implements a Flask-based API that estimates the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** using a linear regression model inspired by the **Rubin Causal Model**. It determines the causal impact of a treatment (e.g. participation in a carbon offset program) on engagement score, controlling for sustainability spending.

---

## 🧠 Model

The regression formula used is:

```
Yᵉ = α + τ·Wᵉ + β·Xᵉ + εᵉ
```

Where:
- **Yᵉ**: Engagement Score (observed outcome)
- **Wᵉ**: Treatment indicator (1 = participated, 0 = did not)
- **Xᵉ**: Sustainability Spending ($1,000s)
- **α, τ, β**: Parameters to be estimated
- **τ**: Interpreted as the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**
